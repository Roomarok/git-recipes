        <h2>Instructions for the recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the mangos and chop them into small cubes</li>
            <li>Put the sugar and the chopped mangos inside a <strong>Pressure Pan</strong>. Turn on the heat, mix it until the sugar melts the close it and leave in medium heat for 4 minutes then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully when opening the pan, make sure there is not much pressure left. You will notice that the mixture is very jellowy, that's the point of it.</li>
            <li>Put the contents off the unflavored gelatin pac in the mixture, mix it well and let it cool down in the fridge.</li>
            <li>In my case i like to leave it for 24 hour inside before eating, but it's all personal.</li>
        </ol>
